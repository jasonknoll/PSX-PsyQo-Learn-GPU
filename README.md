# PSX-PsyQo-Learn-GPU

Although I wish I had better names for projects, this one is dedicated to learning the GPU and GTE libraries from PsyQo to allow myself to work with graphics on the PSX platform. As much as I want to use PsyQ, people seem to have issue regarding it's legality to use. It is abandonware from Sony, but they could pull a *Nintendo move* and claim it's piracy to use software they don't profit from. 

The creator of PsyQo was a nice guy and the community surrounding PSX seems like a fun place to be. They were helpful even with my noob-dumb questions. I hope I can finish a few projects and have fun while at it.
